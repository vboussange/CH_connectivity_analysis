This repository contains the code used to assess the contribution of a pixel to the ecological connectivity at the Swiss landscape level, within the context of the [SPEED2ZERO](https://speed2zero.ethz.ch/en/) project.

The importance of a pixel for supporting ecological connectivity is evaluated by quantifying how a marginal change in habitat quality and/or permeability affects the overall ecological connectivity of the landscape for a certain taxonomic group. This marginal change is called [quality or permeability *elasticity*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(economics)#Definition). These elasticities are calculated with the JAX library [`jaxscape`](https://github.com/vboussange/jaxscape).

Maps obtained at the taxonomic group level are aggregated groups to obtain a single **importance index for ecological connectivity**.

> Aggregated importance index for ecological connectivity at 25m resolution. Higher values indicate higher contribution of the pixels for overall ecological connectivity, implying larger loss of connectivity if the pixel's ecological quality or permeability is degraded.

A manuscript detailing the approach will be available soon.


## Requirements

#### Hardware
A JAX compatible GPU is to be prefered.

#### Dependencies
To install the dependencies, make sure you have conda (or mamba), go to `python/` and run
```
conda env create --file environment.yml --prefix ./.env
```

#### Input data
The analysis depends on suitability maps for each taxonomic group considered. This data must be downloaded from [this Zenodo archive]() and placed under `data/`.

## File description
The elasticities at the taxonomic group level are calculated with the `python/biodiv_layer/group_elasticity_*.py` scripts. They are aggregated with the script `group_summed_elasticities`.

Utilities are placed in `src/`.

## Results
Elasticity and the aggregated importance index maps are hosted under [this Zenodo archive]().
